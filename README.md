# 📊 Reproducible Analysis Project

This repository is structured to support a fully **reproducible data analysis workflow**, from raw data to final report output.

## 📁 Folder Structure

## 📝 Folder Descriptions

- **01_rawdata/**:  
  Store raw input data files here. These files should remain unchanged to ensure reproducibility.

- **02_data/**:  
  Contains intermediate and final data products after cleaning and processing.

- **03_scripts/**:  
  Includes all R or Python scripts used for cleaning, analysis, visualization, and reporting.

- **04_documentation/**:  
  Contains written documentation, such as methodology notes, report drafts, and final outputs (e.g., PDF, HTML, DOCX reports).

## 🧩 Key Scripts

- **`user_profile.R`**:  
  This script ensures compatibility and reproducibility across different systems. It may include:
  - Package loading/install instructions
  - Path configuration
  - Environment variables

- **`run_project.R`**:  
  This master script runs the entire pipeline from raw data to final report.  
  ✅ Input: files from `01_rawdata/`  
  ✅ Output: report in `04_documentation/`

To execute the full workflow, simply run:

```r
source("run_project.R")
```

## 🔁 Reproducibility Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
   ```

2. Open R or RStudio and run:
   ```r
   source("user_profile.R")
   source("run_project.R")
   ```

3. The output report will be saved in the `04_documentation/` folder.
